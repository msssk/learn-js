			<p>Web browsers can load JavaScript code from a file and run it. They can also run code live as you type it.</p>

			<div class="box action">Press <kbd>F12</kbd> to open the developer tools, then click on the <code>Console</code> tab.</div>

			<p>You can type code directly, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and it will be executed. Try some simple expressions:</p>

			<ul class="code">
				<li>1</li>
				<li>1 + 1</li>
				<li>'green'</li>
				<li>green</li>
			</ul>

			<p>You should have gotten an error after that last one. This is because JavaScript doesn't know what
				<code>green</code> is. But you can tell JavaScript what <code>green</code> is! Try the following:
			</p>

			<ul class="code">
				<li>green = 5</li>
				<li>green</li>
			</ul>

			<p>You've just defined the variable <code>green</code>. You can now use it:</p>

			<ul class="code">
				<li>green + 1</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="box tip">
				JavaScript has a set of defined words that can be used in your code, but can't be used as variable
				names.

				So far you've done very simple things. Information and values are collectively referred to as "data" in
				programming. The kind of data you are storing is referred to as a "data type". In JavaScript there are
				a few simple data types known as "primitive data types:"
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li><code>string</code>: Examples: "green", "Name", "A full sentence can be a string"</li>
				<li><code>number</code>: Examples: 1, 5, -5000, 1e5</li>
				<li><code>boolean</code>: Examples: <code>true</code>, <code>false</code></li>
			</ol>

			<div class="box tip">
				This is good to get you started, but there's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">
				a lot more to learn about JavaScript data types</a>.
			</div>

			<div class="box summary">
				Reviewing what you've done so far, you should notice a few things:

				<ol>
					<li>JavaScript has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators">operators</a>,
						you've already used <code>+</code> and <code>=</code></li>
					<li>When you want to create some data you can store it in a "variable"</li>
					<li>Variables are assigned a value with the <code>=</code> operator</li>
				</ol>
